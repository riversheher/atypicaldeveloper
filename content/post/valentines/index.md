Last night, I found myself in a twisted world.  I was a depraved demon, lost in the depths of a dark labyrinth, chasing *you*.  No matter how fast I ran through its shadowy corridors, I could never catch *you*.  Each step left me more desperate, more despairing.  When I awoke, I was shaken.  But as the morning sun streamed through the window, I began to reflect on the dream.  It wasn’t just any nightmare, it was a mirror reflecting my deepest fears and insecurities.

The labyrinth I chased *you* through felt endless, like a maze with no exit.  Every turn led me deeper into confusion and frustration, a spiral of self-doubt that seemed inescapable.  But as I ran, a realization began to dawn on me: the labyrinth wasn’t real.  It was a figment of my imagination, a prison built from my own fear and insecurity.  I could have stepped away at any moment, but I chose to keep chasing.  I convinced myself the labyrinth was real even when it was clearly an illusion.  It had to be real...  Otherwise, wouldn't my struggle be meaningless?

In my dream, I wasn’t chasing *you* to hurt *you*; I was chasing *you* because I was afraid of losing *you*.  The demon I had become was fuelled by jealousy and insecurity, a manifestation of my own fears.  But eventually, I stopped running.  I realized the chase wasn’t the answer.  Love isn’t about possession or control; love is about trust, respect, and letting go of the fear that *you*’ll leave.  As that truth settled in, the demon within me faded away and the labyrinth dissolved into nothingness.  For the first time, I saw clearly: I didn’t need to chase *you*, because *you* were already here.

Yet why do I fear *you* may see me as incomplete?  How come when I look at my reflection, I see a fractured thing: a depraved, desperate demon?  I’ve let myself believe that my flaws are failures rather than the artifacts of the human I’m becoming.  These fractures I once feared are now the very places where *your* light spills through.  Not to fix a broken thing, but to reveal the beautiful features of my unique being.  The demon I saw in my reflection was not a demon at all, but an angel who did not yet know it.

I don’t know why my brain decided to subject me to a  nightmare, but I’m grateful for it.  It reminded me that love is not easy, but it’s worth it.  Love is worth the slow unravelling of every lie we’ve told ourselves no matter how scary that can be.  The person I want to be, the person we both deserve, is not someone flawless, but someone brave enough to look in the mirror and accept the cracks that can be seen.

So thank *you*.  Thank *you* for being patient with me, for being the light when the labyrinth grew dark and for seeing the angel beneath the demon’s guise.  *You* are the proof that love is not the absence of fear, but the resolve to live with it and push through.

I love *you*, and I’m learning to love myself, too.
